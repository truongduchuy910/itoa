Itoa 5 has officially moved into active maintenance mode as we push towards the next major new version of ItoaJS.

## What is Itoa Next?

[Itoa Next](https://next.itoa.vn) is a **preview** of Itoa 6, our next major release. We’ve substantially rewritten the CLI, Schema config, and Admin UI to make them more powerful and easier to use than ever before.

In the last six months we built around the existing stable core of Itoa 5’s packages to test the changes we wanted to make and validate our ideas. We’re now happy with what we’ve built, and **over the course of this year, Itoa Next will become Itoa 6**.

There is a lot to do, and with a larger than ever team at [Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.com.au) working on it, we’re excited to [share what we’re planning](https://next.itoa.vn/roadmap) and get it shipped!

## What happens to Itoa 5?

Itoa 5 remains production-ready in active maintenance mode and now lives at [itoa/itoa](https://github.com/itoa-vn/itoa).

### What does maintenance mode entail?

- You can generally expect Itoa 5 to be feature-frozen as we work on the new version.
- Bugs, minor changes and security features will continue to be addressed and updated versions of the Itoa 5 packages will continue to be released regularly.
- The core team is not expecting to spend time working on new features or large changes.
- If you have a larger change you want to submit as a PR to Itoa 5, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/itoa-vn/itoaissues/new) to discuss it with us.
- We are not closing the door to community-contributed features through the maintenance period, but depending on the scope of the change and the work involved we may suggest maintaining your own fork.
- The duration of this active maintenance mode will depend on community adoption of the new version of Itoa, and how long it takes us to reach feature parity and stability with Itoa Next.
- We expect this active maintenance mode to last for 6 to 12 months.

### What about open PRs and Issues?

If you have a PR or Issue relating to Itoa 5, please open it in our [new repo](https://github.com/itoa-vn/itoa).

## Which version should you use?

It depends on the requirements for your project. If you need a stable and battle-tested foundation, use Itoa 5. If you’re happy to deal with a few updates as we transition to Itoa 6,then Itoa Next is for you.

Thanks for your continued support as we push towards Itoa 6! ✨
