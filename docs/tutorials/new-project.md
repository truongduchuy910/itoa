# Creating a new project

In this guide we will learn how to manually create and run a new Itoa project.

## Database preparation

Before running a Itoa application you need to ensure you have a database set
up. This tutorial requires you to have a MongoDB database setup. Follow the
[database setup instructions](/docs/quick-start/adapters.md) here to ensure your
database is ready to go.

## Initialisation

First things first. Create a directory for your project and initialise it:

```shell allowCopy=false showLanguage=false
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
yarn init
```

Let's start with the minimal setup. We will need two packages here:
`@itoa/itoa`, which is the core of Itoa, and
`@itoa/adapter-mongoose`, which allows our app to connect to MongoDB:

```shell
yarn add @itoa/itoa @itoa/adapter-mongoose
```

## First steps

After installation we can start coding. The main entry point of a Itoa app
is the `index.js` file in the root folder. Create it and add the following:

```javascript title=index.js
const { Itoa } = require('@itoa/itoa');
const { MongooseAdapter } = require('@itoa/adapter-mongoose');

const itoa = new Itoa({
  adapter: new MongooseAdapter({ mongoUri: 'mongodb://localhost/itoa' }),
});
```

You can specify any suitable name for your project. Note that we created an
instance of the [Mongoose adapter](/packages/adapter-mongoose/README.md) and
passed it to `Itoa`'s constructor.

Now we can export our `Itoa` instance and make it available to run. Add the
following to the end of `index.js`:

```javascript title=index.js
module.exports = {
  itoa,
};
```

Although our app doesn't do much yet, it *is* able to start and connect to a
database.

<!-- FIXME:TL How exactly does this happen? How do we know? -->

## GraphQL setup

As in the previous step, install the necessary package.

```shell
yarn add @itoa/app-graphql
```

Import it in index.js:

```javascript title=index.js
const { GraphQLApp } = require('@itoa/app-graphql');
```

And add a new array export named `apps` with a new instance of `GraphQLApp`, like so:

```javascript title=index.js
module.exports = {
  itoa,
  apps: [new GraphQLApp()],
};
```

## Adding a list

In order to be able to start an app we need to add at least one `List`. A `List`
is a model that is compatible with Itoa's Admin UI.

Lists are composed of `fields`. To add fields to a list, we must install the
`@itoa/fields` package:

```shell
yarn add @itoa/fields
```

In this example the field type `Text` is used, which must be `required` in `index.js`:

```javascript title=index.js
const { Text } = require('@itoa/fields');
```

Create your first list in `index.js` by adding the following before the module
export and after instantiating `Itoa`:

```javascript title=index.js
itoa.createList('Todo', {
  fields: {
    name: { type: Text },
  },
});
```

This code snippet creates a List named `Todo`. The second argument is a config
object. For now it has only one key (`fields`) which is used to define the
schema for the newly created model.

In our example, the `Todo` list has a single field called `name` of type `Text`.

## Starting the application

Add the following to `package.json`:

```json title=package.json
"scripts": {
  "start:dev": "itoa"
}
```

Now ensure that `mongod` is running and execute the start script:

```shell
yarn start:dev
```

You should see something like this:

```shell allowCopy=false showLanguage=false
âœ” Itoa instance is ready ðŸš€
ðŸ”— GraphQL Playground:   http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql
ðŸ”— GraphQL API:          http://localhost:3000/admin/api
```

Now it's time to check those routes in browser to ensure that everything works
as expected.

## Summary

Congratulations, you have just set up your very first Itoa application;
including a GraphQL API and a GraphQL Playground which you start interacting
with.

In future tutorials we will show you how to execute queries and mutations
with this API, and launch a browser based Admin UI to explore and interact with
your data.
